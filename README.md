# LinkedList

Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. This has to be done by reversing the list by changing links between nodes.

For example:

Input : Head of following linked list  
       1->2->3->4->NULL
Output : Linked list should be changed to,
       4->3->2->1->NULL

Input : Head of following linked list  
       1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output : Linked list should be changed to,
       5->4->3->2->1->NULL

Input : NULL
Output : NULL

Input  : 1->NULL
Output : 1->NULL
